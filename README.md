Required dependencies are defined in requirements.txt with a smaller version requirements_colab.txt if being run in google colab. 

Pretrained weights can be loaded from the several files in the root of this repository and naming convension is generally: 
ModeltypeState_epochs_chunksize_overlap (occasionally not all hyperparameters are defined in the name, typically cause they are set to the default used in the notebook).
Some extra details of some of the generalizer models are available in the model_details folder.
